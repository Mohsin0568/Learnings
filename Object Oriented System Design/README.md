# Object Oriented System Design

## Basics:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming that focuses on using objects to design and build applications. Contrary to procedure-oriented programming where programs are designed as blocks of statements to manipulate data, OOP organizes the program to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an “Object”.


## OO Analysis and Design:

OO Analysis and Design is a structured method for analyzing and designing a system by applying object-oriented concepts. This design process consists of an investigation into the objects constituting the system. It starts by first identifying the objects of the system and then figuring out the interactions between various objects.

The process of OO analysis and design can be described as:
1. Identifying the objects in a system;
2. Defining relationships between objects;
3. Establishing the interface of each object; and,
4. Making a design, which can be converted to executables using OO languages.
