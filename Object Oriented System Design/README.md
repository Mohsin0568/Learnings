# Object Oriented System Design

## Basics:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming that focuses on using objects to design and build applications. Contrary to procedure-oriented programming where programs are designed as blocks of statements to manipulate data, OOP organizes the program to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an “Object”.


## OO Analysis and Design:

OO Analysis and Design is a structured method for analyzing and designing a system by applying object-oriented concepts. This design process consists of an investigation into the objects constituting the system. It starts by first identifying the objects of the system and then figuring out the interactions between various objects.

The process of OO analysis and design can be described as:
1. Identifying the objects in a system;
2. Defining relationships between objects;
3. Establishing the interface of each object; and,
4. Making a design, which can be converted to executables using OO languages.

## UML: 

UML stands for Unified Modelling Language and is used to model the Object-Oriented Analysis of a software system. UML is a way of visualizing and documenting a software system by using a collection of diagrams, which helps engineers, businesspeople, and system architects understand the behavior and structure of the system being designed.

Benefits of using UML:
1. Helps develop a quick understanding of a software system.
2. UML modelling helps in breaking a complex system into discrete pieces that can be easily understood.
3. UML’s graphical notations can be used to communicate design decisions.
4. Since UML is independent of any specific platform or language or technology, it is easier to abstract out concepts.
5. It becomes easier to hand the system over to a new team.

Structural UML diagrams
* Class diagram
* Object diagram
* Package diagram
* Component diagram
* Composite structure diagram
* Deployment diagram
* Profile diagram

Behavioral UML diagrams
* Use case diagram
* Activity diagram
* Sequence diagram
* State diagram
* Communication diagram
* Interaction overview diagram
* Timing diagram

## Use Case Diagrams:

Use case diagrams describe a set of actions (called use cases) that a system should or can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system (called actors). Each use case should provide some observable and valuable result to the actors.

1. Use Case Diagrams describe the high-level functional behavior of the system.
2. It answers what system does from the user point of view.
3. Use case answers ‘What will the system do?’ and at the same time tells us ‘What will the system NOT do?’.
